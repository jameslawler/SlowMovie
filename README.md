# SlowMovie

This is a fork from https://github.com/TomWhitwell/SlowMovie.

This version does not depend on ffmpeg. Instead it takes the frames as images from athe `Images` folder.

Images must be named as a frame number `0001.png` -> `9999.png`.

Once an images is not found, the program stops and the screen is cleared.
